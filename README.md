# Soduku-C-Programming-Project
9x9 Sudoku game maintains fixed numbers and empty places.

# Game Description

	A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

🚧 Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.

🚧 Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.

🚧 Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.

🚧 The ' ' character indicates empty cells and NOTE THAT: If you need to delete a written number, you can write at the location 0 so that it will be returned to ' '.

🚀 Approach:

🌟 First check at each position one number has placed.

🌟 it must be only one number in the row and also at the shared column with that row".

🌟 if cell is empty then try to place number from 1 to 9 and with each number check if this place available to be filled by that number?

🌟 if it is available to that place to be filled by that number, call for next cell.

🌟 use #changing or #deleting if any of number cannot be placed in cell to replace previous number by calling the specific cell and putting if you need to delete this number or assign another one 😍.
